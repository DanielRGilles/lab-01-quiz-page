            <h1> All about Aardvarks</h1>
            <h2>Name</h2>
            <p>The aardvark (/ˈɑːrdvɑːrk/ ARD-vark; Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal
                native to Africa. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other
                prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike most other insectivores, it has a long
                pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the
                African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and
                termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to
                create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a "least concern" rating from the IUCN,
                although its numbers seem to be decreasing.
                Aardvarks are afrotheres, a clade which also includes elephants, manatees, and hyraxes. </p>
            <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
            <section class="article">The name"aardvark" is Afrikaans (Afrikaans pronunciation: [ˈɑːrtfark]), comes from
                earlier Afrikaans
                (erdvark) and means "earth pig" or "ground pig" (aarde: earth/ground, vark: pig), because of its
                burrowing habits; it is also the first polysyllabic word in many English dictionaries. The name
                Orycteropus means burrowing foot, and the name afer refers to Africa. The name of the aardvarks's
                order, Tubulidentata, comes from the tubule-style teeth.<br>
                The aardvark is sometimes colloquially called
                <ul>
                    <li>African ant bear</li>
                    <li>anteater</li>
                    <li>Cape anteater</li>
                </ul>

            </section>
            <h2>Evolutionary history</h2>
            <p>The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole
                extant representative of the
                obscure mammalian order Tubulidentata,in which it is usually considered to form one variable
                species of the genus Orycteropus, the sole surviving genus in the family Orycteropodidae. The aardvark
                is not closely related to the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a
                superficial resemblance. The similarities are based on convergent evolution. The closest living
                relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, tenrecs and golden moles.Along with the
                sirenians, hyraxes, elephants, and their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder
                Afrotheria. Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with Condylarthra, and given the
                clade's status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as "condylarths"
                are actually stem-aardvarks.</p>
